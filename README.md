### Projects On Artificial Intelligence


***Project 1.*** [Sudoku](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Sudoku):  

Created an AI to solve Diagonal Sudokus using constraint propagation and search techniques. Additionally, taught the agent to use the Naked Twins advanced Sudoku strategy. [Source Code](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Sudoku)

---------------------------------

***Project 2.*** [Isolation](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Isolation):  

Created an AI that beats human opponents in the game of Isolation using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Search, and Iterative Deepening.[Source Code](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Isolation)

---------------------------------

***Project 3.*** [Planning](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Planning): 

Used logic and planning techniques to create an AI that finds the most e cient route to route cargo around the world to their respective destinations. This project used a combination of propositional logic and search along with A* heuristics to find optimal planning solutions. [Source Code](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Planning)

---------------------------------


***Project 4.*** [Recognizer-HMM](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Recognizer) : 

Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of a preprocessed data set of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from the video to try and identify individual words from test sequences. Experimented with model selection techniques including BIC, DIC, and K-fold Cross Validation.[Source Code](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-Recognizer/blob/master/asl_recognizer.ipynb)

---------------------------------

***Project 5.*** [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/sadhi003/aind2-rnn):

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties. [Source Code](https://github.com/sadhi003/aind2-rnn/tree/master/Smartcab)

---------------------------------

***Project 6.*** [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/sadhi003/AIND-CV-Mimic):

Built Generative adversarial networks (GANS) which pits two neural networks in competition, allowing these networks to model reality with amazing accuracy. [Source Code](https://github.com/Vasuji/DLND-face-generation)
